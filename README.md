# Curiosity Challenge: 

## Can We Teach Computers to Understand Emotion? 

### Researching the Digital Generation 
Each of us lays down invisible digital footprints as we move around and interact with the modern world. 
Our movements are logged by our phones and sat navs, our activity is monitored by wearable sensors, and our social media interactions form part of a worldwide conversation. 
This shared digital information allows us to engage with the world in ways that were unthinkable for previous 
generations. 
Businesses use this huge amount of data to understand their customers and offer services such as finding the best 
route through a busy city or suggesting products you might like based on what you’ve just bought. 
But our digital footprints are useful for health researchers too. 

They can use digital information shared by people taking part in their research to understand important issues such as the spread of disease, or the development of mental health problems. 
Some types of information, such as the emotions we express on social media, are easy for most humans to understand. 
But health researchers often work with groups of thousands of people, like Bristol’s famous Children of the Nineties 
study. It would be impossible and intrusive for researchers to read and interpret every social media post themselves. 
Computers, on the other hand, work extremely quickly, but have difficulty with some tasks that humans typically find 
straightforward. Can human and artificial intelligence work together on this, combining the strengths of both to 
improve human health? Or, to put it another way, can we teach computers to understand emotion?
