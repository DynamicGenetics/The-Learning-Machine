"""
This module provides access to the FER+ (Facial Emotion Recognition Plus)
as encapsulated as a `torchvision.datasets.VisionDataset` class.

Notes
-----
The FER+ annotations provide a set of new labels for the standard FER dataset.
In FER+, each image has been labeled by 10 crowd-sourced taggers, which provide
better quality ground truth for each image/emotion than the original FER labels.

Having 10 taggers for each image enables researchers to estimate an emotion
probability distribution per face.
This allows constructing algorithms that produce statistical distributions or
multi-label outputs instead of the conventional single-label output,
as described in [1]_

The new label file is named `fer2013new.csv` and contains the same number of rows
as the original `fer2013.csv` label file with the same order,
so that you infer which emotion tag belongs to which image.

The format of the CSV file is as follows:
```
usage, neutral, happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, contempt, unknown, NF
```
Columns "usage" is the same as the original FER label to differentiate between
_Training_, _Public test_, and _Private test_ (validation) sets.

The other columns are the **vote count** for each emotion with the addition of
`unknown` and `NF` (i.e. _Not a Face_).
