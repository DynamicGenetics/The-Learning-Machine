# Learning Machine API Specification

This folder contains the specifications for the API of the 
learning machine as defined according to the 
[OpenAPI 3.0.3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md)
standard.

The specification are available in both **YAML** and in **JSON** format:
- [Learning Machine APIs Specs `.yaml`](learning_machine_api_specs.yaml)
- [Learning Machine APIs Specs `.json`](learning_machine_api_specs.json)

This API Specification is also available on
 
- [**Postman**](https://www.postman.com) - within the `WeTheCurious` 
 workspace ([Join](https://app.getpostman.com/join-team?invite_code=ff3ae171da77809da57062bf4ae92aef&ws=7f8056d8-39db-48d0-8d74-0d038ad4e7db));
- [**SwaggerHub**](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/leriomaggio/learning_machine/1.0.0) 

for documentation and testability. 
In particular, the easy-to-navigate documentation of 
the APIs is complemented by examples providing details on 
`request` and `response` methods and objects for each of the 
generated endpoints. 


##### Technical Notes:

To enable the support of `OpenAPI` syntax highlighting and auto-completion 
there are a lot of plugins for the most common editors and IDE.

More information on [OpenAPI Tools](https://openapi.tools/), and specifically on [Text Editors](https://openapi.tools/#text-editors). 
For **JetBrains** IDE (e.g. PyCharm), I personally suggest using the [Swagger](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8347-swagger) plugin - available for free in the Marketplace.
